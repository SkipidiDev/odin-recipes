# Odin Recipes

> "Every expert was once a beginner." This is my first project from The Odin Project curriculum, and the beginning of my web development journey! 

## About This Project

This is my **very first web development project** - a basic recipe website built with HTML. While it might seem simple, this project represents an important milestone: taking the leap from learning theory to building something real that lives on the web.

## Description

A basic recipe website built with HTML to demonstrate my understanding of HTML fundamentals. Each line of code in this project is a small victory in my journey to becoming a developer.

## What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

- **HTML structure** - Understanding how web pages are built from the ground up
- **Links and navigation** - Connecting pages together to create a cohesive experience
- **Lists** - Organizing information in a clear, readable way
- **Images** - Adding visual elements to make pages come alive
- **Git basics** - Version control and the foundation of professional development workflows

## Why This Matters

This project might not have fancy styling or JavaScript interactivity yet, but it's proof that I can:
- Take what I've learned and build something functional
- Follow best practices for HTML structure
- Use Git for version control like a real developer
- Complete a project from start to finish

## The Journey Continues

This is just the beginning. Every line of code I write brings me one step closer to my goals. Looking back at this project in the future will remind me how far I've come.
