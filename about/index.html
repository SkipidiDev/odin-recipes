    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    
    <p><em>"Every expert was once a beginner."</em> This is my first project from The Odin Project curriculum, and the beginning of my web development journey!</p>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This is my <strong>very first web development project</strong>, a basic recipe website built with HTML. While it might seem simple, this project represents an important milestone: taking the leap from learning theory to building something real that lives on the web.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A basic recipe website built with HTML to demonstrate my understanding of HTML fundamentals. Each line of code in this project is a small victory in my journey to becoming a developer.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>Building this project taught me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML structure</strong> - Understanding how web pages are built from the ground up</li>
        <li><strong>Links and navigation</strong> - Connecting pages together to create a cohesive experience</li>
        <li><strong>Lists</strong> - Organizing information in a clear, readable way</li>
        <li><strong>Images</strong> - Adding visual elements to make pages come alive</li>
        <li><strong>Git basics</strong> - Version control and the foundation of professional development workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>This project might not have fancy styling or JavaScript interactivity yet, but it's proof that I can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take what I've learned and build something functional</li>
        <li>Follow best practices for HTML structure</li>
        <li>Use Git for version control like a real developer</li>
        <li>Complete a project from start to finish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Journey Continues</h2>
    <p>This is just the beginning. Every line of code I write brings me one step closer to my goals. Looking back at this project in the future will remind me how far I've come.</p>
