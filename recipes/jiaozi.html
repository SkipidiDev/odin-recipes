    <h2>The Symbol of Wealth and Reunion</h2>
    <p>This recipe is defined by its <strong>historical significance</strong>; Jiaozi are traditional Chinese dumplings that have been a staple for over 1,800 years. Shaped like ancient gold ingots (sycee), they are a powerful symbol of <strong>wealth and prosperity</strong>, often served during the Lunar New Year to bring good fortune.</p>

    <h2>The Art of the Juicy Filling</h2>
    <p>A critical characteristic of this dish is the <strong>tender, savory filling</strong>, typically made with a blend of ground pork and finely shredded napa cabbage. To ensure the perfect texture, the meat is stirred vigorously in <strong>one direction</strong> until it becomes sticky, allowing the aromatics like ginger and sesame oil to fully permeate the mixture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><strong>The Savory Filling</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ground Pork:</strong> 1 lb (500g) fatty ground pork for maximum juiciness.</li>
      <li><strong>Napa Cabbage:</strong> 2 cups finely shredded and squeezed of excess moisture.</li>
      <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> 1 tbsp minced ginger, 3 cloves minced garlic, and 2 finely chopped scallions.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine, and 1 tsp salt.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Wrappers and Dipping Sauce</strong></p> 
    <ul> 
      <li><strong>Wrappers:</strong> 1 pack of round dumpling wrappers (approximately 40–50 pieces).</li> 
      <li><strong>Dipping Sauce Base:</strong> 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp Chinkiang black vinegar.</li> 
      <li><strong>Sauce Aromatics:</strong> 1 tsp chili oil and 1 clove of minced garlic.</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> Combine the ground pork, ginger, garlic, and liquid seasonings in a large bowl. Stir vigorously in one direction until the meat becomes sticky, then fold in the shredded cabbage.</li>
      <li><strong>Fill the Wrappers:</strong> Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of a wrapper. Lightly wet the outer edges of the wrapper with water to act as an adhesive.</li>
      <li><strong>Pleat and Seal:</strong> Fold the wrapper into a half-moon shape. Create small pleats along the top edge and pinch tightly to seal the dumpling, ensuring no air is trapped inside.</li>
      <li><strong>Boil the Jiaozi:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and carefully drop in the dumplings. Stir gently with a spoon to prevent them from sticking to the bottom.</li>
      <li><strong>The Water Addition Method:</strong> When the water returns to a boil, add half a cup of cold water. Repeat this process twice more; when the dumplings float to the surface after the final boil, they are ready.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble and Serve:</strong> Use a slotted spoon to drain the dumplings and transfer them to a platter. Serve immediately while hot alongside the prepared dipping sauce.</li>
