    <h2>The Legendary Crispy Skin</h2>
    <p>This recipe is defined by its <strong>shattering crispy skin</strong> and succulent meat, a royal dish dating back to the Imperial era of China. The secret lies in the <strong>air-drying</strong> process, which separates the skin from the fat, allowing it to crisp up perfectly during roasting. It is traditionally served with thin mandarin pancakes, sweet bean sauce, and fresh aromatics.</p>

    <h2>The Art of the Glaze</h2>
    <p>A critical step in this recipe involves repeatedly bathing the duck in a <strong>maltose syrup glaze</strong>. This coating not only provides the signature deep mahogany color but also creates a thin, candy-like shell that enhances the texture of the skin. When carved, the skin is often dipped in sugar to highlight its <strong>delicate crunch</strong> and rich flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><strong>The Duck and Glaze</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whole Duck:</strong> 4–5 lb (2kg) whole duck with skin intact and head/neck preferred.</li>
      <li><strong>Glaze Base:</strong> 1/2 cup maltose (or honey), 1/2 cup water, and 2 tbsp red rice vinegar.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Seasoning:</strong> 2 tbsp Chinese five-spice powder, 2 tbsp salt, and 3 slices of ginger.</li>
      <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> 2 whole star anise and 1 cinnamon stick.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For Serving</strong></p> 
    <ul> 
      <li><strong>Mandarin Pancakes:</strong> 20 thin steamed flour pancakes.</li> 
      <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> 1/2 cup Hoisin sauce or Sweet Bean Sauce (Tianmianjiang).</li> 
      <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> 1 cucumber (julienned) and 4 scallions (white parts only, shredded).</li> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Duck:</strong> Clean the duck thoroughly and pat it dry. Use a straw or air pump to carefully blow air between the skin and the meat to separate them.</li>
      <li><strong>Scald the Skin:</strong> Pour boiling water over the entire surface of the duck until the skin tightens and turns white. Drain and pat dry again.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply the Glaze:</strong> Bring the maltose, vinegar, and water to a simmer. Brush the glaze evenly over the skin, then let it dry in a cool, drafty place for at least 12–24 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Seasoning:</strong> Rub the five-spice powder and salt inside the cavity. Stuff with ginger, star anise, and cinnamon before sealing the cavity with a skewer.</li>
      <li><strong>Roast the Duck:</strong> Place the duck on a rack in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C). Roast for about 70–90 minutes, turning halfway through, until the skin is dark red and crispy.</li>
      <li><strong>The Resting Phase:</strong> Remove the duck from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring the meat stays moist.</li>
      <li><strong>Carving:</strong> Use a sharp knife to carefully slice the crispy skin first, then the meat into thin, bite-sized pieces.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Spread a little sauce on a pancake, add a piece of duck skin, meat, cucumber, and scallion. Fold and serve immediately.</li>
