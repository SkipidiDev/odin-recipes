    <h2>The Bold Mala Flavor</h2>
    <p>This recipe is defined by its <strong>"mala"</strong> flavor,
      a signature of Sichuan cuisine that combines the numbing sensation of Sichuan peppercorns with the fiery heat of dried red chilies.
      The beef is typically sliced paper-thin and <strong>"velveted"</strong> (marinated in a mixture of cornstarch and rice wine) to ensure it stays incredibly tender.
      It is then quickly poached in a rich, spicy broth built from a base of doubanjiang (fermented broad bean paste),
      ginger, and garlic.</p>

    <h2>The Sizzling Oil Technique</h2>
    <p>A critical final step in this recipe involves layering fresh minced garlic, dried chili flakes,
      and scallions over the cooked beef and vegetables. <strong>Sizzling hot oil</strong> is then poured directly over these aromatics,
      flash-frying them instantly to release a deep, smoky fragrance and vibrant red color. This technique creates the shimmering,
      oily surface seen in your image and ensures the spices permeate every bite of the dish</p>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Marinate the Beef:</strong> Toss the thinly sliced beef with soy sauce, wine, and baking soda. After 15 minutes, mix in the egg white and cornstarch until velvety.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetable Bed:</strong> Quickly stir-fry your chosen greens with a pinch of salt until wilted. Place them at the bottom of a deep serving bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Build the Spicy Broth:</strong> In a wok, sauté ginger, garlic, and scallions. Add the Doubanjiang and stir-fry until the oil turns red.</li>
    <li><strong>Boil the Broth:</strong> Pour in the stock and bring to a rolling boil. Let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    <li><strong>Poach the Beef:</strong> Reduce heat to a simmer. Carefully drop beef slices in one by one. Cook for only 60–90 seconds until just opaque.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Pour the beef and spicy broth over the vegetables in your serving bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>The Final Sizzle:</strong> Sprinkle minced garlic, chili flakes, and ground Sichuan peppercorns on top. Heat 1/4 cup oil until shimmering.</li>
    <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Carefully pour the hot oil directly over the spices. Garnish with fresh cilantro or scallion greens.</li>
